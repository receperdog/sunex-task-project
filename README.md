# Sunex Task Project

This project is a simple task management application built using ASP.NET Core 8.0. It demonstrates a clean architecture pattern, separating the Data Access Layer (DAL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Presentation Layer (PL) into distinct components. Unit tests have been written for each layer to ensure the correctness and robustness of the application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

### 1. **Data (DAL)**
   - **Location:** `sunex-task-project/Data`
   - **Description:** This folder contains the Data Access Layer, which is responsible for interacting with the database. It includes:
     - `AppDbContext.cs`: Entity Framework Core context for managing database operations.
     - `ITaskRepository.cs`: Interface defining the contract for data operations.
     - `TaskRepository.cs`: Implementation of the repository pattern for data access.

### 2. **Services (BLL)**
   - **Location:** `sunex-task-project/Services`
   - **Description:** This folder contains the Business Logic Layer, which implements the core business logic of the application. It includes:
     - `ITaskService.cs`: Interface defining the contract for business logic operations.
     - `TaskService.cs`: Implementation of the business logic, including validation and mapping between DTOs and entities.

### 3. **Controllers (PL)**
   - **Location:** `sunex-task-project/Controllers`
   - **Description:** This folder contains the Presentation Layer, which handles HTTP requests and responses. It includes:
     - `TasksController.cs`: The API controller for managing task-related operations such as creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting tasks.

### 4. **Middleware**
   - **Location:** `sunex-task-project/Middleware`
   - **Description:** This folder contains middleware components that handle cross-cutting concerns like exception handling. It includes:
     - `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware.cs`: Middleware for handling exceptions globally, logging errors, and returning a standardized JSON response.

### 5. **Tests**
   - **Location:** `tests/sunex_task_project.Tests`
   - **Description:** This folder contains unit tests for the various layers of the application. It includes:
     - `Services`: Tests for the Business Logic Layer (`TaskServiceTests.cs`).
     - `Data`: Tests for the Data Access Layer (`TaskRepositoryTests.cs`).

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0:** The framework used to build the web API.
- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM for database operations.
- **xUnit:** Testing framework for writing unit tests.
- **Moq:** Mocking framework for isolating dependencies in unit tests.
- **AutoMapper:** Library for mapping objects, particularly useful for converting between entities and DTOs.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD tool for automated testing and deployment.

   ```

2. **Restore dependencies:**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

2. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   cd tests/sunex_task_project.Tests
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The pipeline is triggered on every push or pull request to the `master` branch. It automatically:

- Restores dependencies
- Builds the project
- Runs the unit tests

The configuration for this pipeline is located in `.github/workflows/dotnet.yml`.

## Exception Handling Middleware

This project includes a custom `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` to handle exceptions globally across the application. This middleware is responsible for catching exceptions that occur during the processing of HTTP requests and returning a standardized JSON response to the client. Additionally, it logs the exception details, which can be useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### How It Works

The `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` is added to the request processing pipeline early in the application startup. It intercepts all incoming HTTP requests and attempts to process them. If an unhandled exception is thrown during the request processing, the middleware catches the exception, logs it, and returns a JSON response with an appropriate HTTP status code and error message.

### Key Features

- **Global Exception Handling:** Catches exceptions thrown anywhere in the request pipeline, ensuring consistent error handling.
- **Logging:** Uses the built-in logging system to log detailed information about exceptions, which is useful for diagnosing issues.
- **Standardized Error Responses:** Returns a standardized JSON response, making it easier for API clients to handle errors.
- **Cross-Cutting Concern:** Acts as a cross-cutting concern similar to Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) practices, though implemented via middleware in .NET.

### Example of the Error Response

When an exception is caught, the middleware returns a JSON response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "title": "An error occurred",
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "A detailed error message here."
}
```

The status code and message will vary depending on the type of exception caught.

### Middleware Code

Hereâ€™s a brief look at the `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Net;
using System.Text.Json;
using sunex_task_project.Models;
using sunex_task_project.Exceptions;

namespace sunex_task_project.Middleware
{
    public class ExceptionHandlingMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;
        private readonly ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> _logger;

        public ExceptionHandlingMiddleware(RequestDelegate next, ILogger<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware> logger)
        {
            _next = next;
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
        {
            try
            {
                await _next(context);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                await HandleExceptionAsync(context, ex);
            }
        }

        private Task HandleExceptionAsync(HttpContext context, Exception exception)
        {
            _logger.LogError(exception, "An unexpected error occurred");
            context.Response.ContentType = "application/json";

            var statusCode = exception switch
            {
                TaskNotFoundException => HttpStatusCode.NotFound,
                ArgumentException => HttpStatusCode.BadRequest,
                _ => HttpStatusCode.InternalServerError
            };

            context.Response.StatusCode = (int)statusCode;

            var response = new ErrorResponse
            {
                Title = "An error occurred",
                StatusCode = context.Response.StatusCode,
                Message = exception.Message
            };

            var jsonResponse = JsonSerializer.Serialize(response);

            return context.Response.WriteAsync(jsonResponse);
        }
    }
}
```

### How to Use

The middleware is added to the application in the `Program.cs` file:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container, including your own.
builder.Services.AddControllers();

// Register the middleware
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseMiddleware<ExceptionHandlingMiddleware>();

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.MapControllers();
app.Run();
```

By adding the `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` to the pipeline, you ensure that all unhandled exceptions in your application are processed consistently, providing better error handling and logging across the entire application.
